# A baby clone of Patatap. Let's make some noises!
### with libraries: paper.js, howler.js
## USAGE:
Launch (click [here](https://ngnnah.github.io/js_patatap/)) and Press any character key (A to Z)
* Ah, and turn up your speaker :)
### My own twists:
- each key is linked to a circle/rectangular/triangle
- each shape is rotating (`onFrame`) with a random angular velocity

### In this project, I have learned:
* Libraries are super-convenient!
* Working with I/O devices are fun.
